	<p class="movieDetail">Chak De! India explores religious bigotry, religious prejudice and sexism. The film follows Kabir Khan, an exiled hockey player, ousted from the sport as a result of religious prejudice, following a disastrous loss to Pakistan. 7 years later, in an attempt to redeem himself, he becomes the coach of the Indian national women's hockey team, with the goal of turning 16 of its players into an award-winning team.</p>
